#### Get rid of all those pesky banners taking up valuable screen real estate

A little project, just to learn the basics of chrome extensions

You'll need to use [chrome dev mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) and unpack the contents

### How it works

Hold down the **B** key and hover over the element you want to delete.

Currently doesn't work for buttons and iframes. That's the next step.
